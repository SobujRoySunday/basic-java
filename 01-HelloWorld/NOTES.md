## **1. History of Java**

Java was developed by **James Gosling** and his team at Sun Microsystems in 1995. Initially, it was called **Oak** (after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office). However, it was later renamed Java, inspired by Java coffee. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but its potential for broader use led to its adoption for internet applications due to its portability, robustness, and simplicity.

Key milestones in Java's history:
- **1995**: Java 1.0 released, gaining popularity for internet-based applets.
- **2004**: Java SE 5, major updates such as Generics, enhanced for-loop, and metadata.
- **2010**: Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems and took over Java development.
- **2021 and beyond**: Java remains a widely-used language for web development, enterprise applications, mobile apps (via Android), and more.

## **2. Features of Java**

Java offers several features that make it one of the most powerful programming languages:

1. **Simple**: Java syntax is easy to learn, making it a beginner-friendly language. It removes complexities like pointers and operator overloading.
2. **Object-Oriented**: Java is based on the object-oriented paradigm, allowing developers to create modular programs and reusable code.
3. **Platform-Independent**: Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA).
4. **Secured**: Java provides a secure environment by offering features like runtime checking, bytecode verification, and protection from viruses.
5. **Robust**: Java handles errors effectively through exception handling and garbage collection, ensuring stable program execution.
6. **Multithreaded**: Java allows concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program, helping with performance and user experience in applications.
7. **Portable**: Java bytecode is platform-independent, and its libraries are available across different systems, ensuring portability.
8. **Distributed**: Java supports the development of distributed applications with features for sharing data and programs across a network.
9. **High Performance**: Although Java is interpreted, it provides high performance through Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers.
10. **Dynamic**: Java can adapt to evolving environments and is capable of loading classes dynamically at runtime.

## **3. Java Environment**

The Java environment is composed of three key components:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: The JDK provides tools for developing Java applications, such as the compiler (`javac`), debugger, and libraries.
2. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: The JRE contains the JVM and class libraries required to run Java programs. It allows bytecode generated by the compiler to be executed.
3. **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: The JVM is the heart of the Java language, responsible for converting bytecode into machine code for execution. It ensures platform independence by running the same bytecode on any device with a JVM.

### How Java Works:
1. **Write Code**: You write Java code in `.java` files.
2. **Compilation**: The Java compiler (`javac`) converts your source code into **bytecode** (stored in `.class` files).
3. **Execution**: The JVM interprets the bytecode and executes it on the target platform.

## **4. Hello World Program in Java**

Let's start with the simplest Java program, which prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This is often the first program a beginner writes.

```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- `class HelloWorld`: This defines a class named `HelloWorld`. In Java, everything must be part of a class.
- `public static void main(String[] args)`: This is the **main method**. It's the entry point for the JVM to start execution of a Java program.
  - `public`: Means the method is accessible to any other class.
  - `static`: Allows the JVM to call this method without needing to instantiate the class.
  - `void`: This method does not return any value.
  - `String[] args`: This is an array of strings passed to the program as arguments.
- `System.out.println("Hello, World!");`: This prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console. `System.out` is a standard output stream, and `println` is used to print text followed by a new line.
